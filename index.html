            <h4 class="card-title"><span class="label label-success">1</span> Florence, Italy</h4>
            <p class="card-text">Though Rome is Italy’s much beloved capital and Milan has serious cosmopolitan clout, Florence remains unrivaled in history, art, and architecture (its beauty and cuisine don’t hurt, either). In addition to being the birthplace of the Renaissance, the Firenze of recent years has had a modern makeover: study Tuscan classics with celebrity chef Arturo Dori at Desinare, one of the city’s hottest cooking school/design store hybrids, or take in modern art at La Strozzina, Florence’s center for contemporary culture. Wherever the day takes you, save room for a panino al lampredotto—this stewed tripe sandwich is a Florence must.</p>

          <div class="card card-block">
            <h4 class="card-title"><span class="label label-info">2</span> Budapest, Hungary</h4>
            <p class="card-text">With some of the best Art Nouveau architecture in Europe, scenic Budapest has no bad angles. Explore the Hungarian capital’s spa culture with thermal baths built in the 16th and 17th century, and make sure to pay a visit to the ornate New York Kávéház for coffee and a pastry. Walk the Széchenyi Chain Bridge at night over the Danube River for magnificent views, and eat a bowl of traditional gulyás at the three-level Central Market before turning in for the night.</p>

            <h4 class="card-title"><span class="label label-info">3</span> Vienna, Austria</h4>
            <p class="card-text">Artistic, exquisite, and largely shaped by its musical and intellectual foundations, Austria’s capital and largest city is packed with culture. Make time to get a figurative taste of royalty at Schönbrunn, the Habsburgs’ former summer residence, and get an actual taste of Sachertorte, a chocolate cake that is one of the city’s culinary specialties. Just be sure to ask for it mit schlaag—with cream.</p>

          <div class="card card-block">
            <h4 class="card-title"><span class="label label-info">4</span> Sydney, Australia</h4>
            <p class="card-text">Australia’s biggest city is an ideal getaway no matter the season. Dine al fresco and head to Bondi, Manly, and Redleaf beaches in the summer (remember, that’s during our winter), and explore the city’s vibrant arts and culture calendar through Vivid Sydney come winter. Whatever the season, get spectacular views of the city from Sydney Tower’s glass viewing platform.
