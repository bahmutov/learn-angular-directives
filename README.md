> Self-directed study of Angular 1 built-in directives, including a homework assignment

## Angular 1 directives

After completing this study you will be able to:

* Understand the value of `ng-repeat`
* Use `ng-if`, `ng-switch` and `ng-class`
* Find the various event directives available such as `ng-focus`
* Use event directives to call methods in a controller

### Installation

While all these examples require just a static page, and could have been delivered
using [jsbin](http://jsbin.com/) or a similar service, it is much faster to work
with an Angular application when you can easily inspect the DOM and the application
in the browser's DevTools. Thus I advise to clone this repo and open the included
test page as a local file.
